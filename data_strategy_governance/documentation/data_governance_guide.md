# Swiss Data Governance Guide

## Introduction

This guide focuses on implementing a Data Governance Framework for organizations in Switzerland. It addresses **Swiss Data Protection Laws (FADP)**, **GDPR compliance**, and outlines key governance strategies such as data quality management, anonymization of personal data, and naming conventions.

### 1. Swiss Data Protection Laws and GDPR Compliance

Organizations operating in Switzerland must comply with **FADP (Federal Act on Data Protection)** and **GDPR** when handling personal data. This framework helps ensure compliance by anonymizing sensitive data, such as names and emails, and enforcing best practices for data storage and processing.

- **Personal Data**: All personal data such as names, emails, and addresses should be anonymized before being processed in the system.
- **Data Security**: Data should be encrypted, and appropriate security measures should be enforced to prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. Data Quality Checks

Ensuring data quality is crucial for generating reliable insights and maintaining compliance. Common data quality checks include:

- **Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing data.
- **Duplicate Data**: Detect and remove duplicate records.
- **Data Type Consistency**: Ensure that data types (e.g., integers, dates) are consistent across datasets.

### 3. Data Governance Rules

Governance rules standardize the way data is stored and processed across the organization. Examples include:

- **Naming Conventions**: All column names must follow lowercase and underscore format (e.g., `customer_id`).
- **Personal Data Handling**: Sensitive columns (names, emails) should be anonymized in compliance with GDPR and FADP.
- **Audit Trails**: Track data modifications for regulatory audits.

### 4. Framework Overview

The `governance_framework.py` script automates:

- **Data Quality Checks**: Detect missing values and report discrepancies.
- **Personal Data Compliance**: Anonymize sensitive data like customer names and emails.
- **Naming Conventions**: Enforce consistent column naming to improve clarity and reduce errors.

### 5. Usage Instructions

#### Running the Script

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
