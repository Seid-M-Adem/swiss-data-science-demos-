# Predictive Analytics and Forecasting

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and validating sales forecasting models for a Swiss retail chain model data Example. It includes a comprehensive dataset and a variety of tools for time series analysis and model training. The project features:

- **Data Generation**: A script to create realistic sales data.
- **Forecast Model**: A Python script using Scikit-learn to build and validate forecasting models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seid-M-Adem/swiss-data-science-demos-.git
   cd swiss-data-science-demos-
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries. You can use a requirements.txt file if available, or manually install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Generate the Data
Run the generate_data.py script to create the sales_data.csv file:

bash
Copy code
python generate_data.py
Usage

Running the Forecast Model
To run the forecasting model and evaluate its performance, use:

bash
Copy code
python predictive_analytics_forecasting/code/forecast_model.py
This script reads the sales data from data/sales_data.csv, trains a Random Forest Regressor model, and evaluates its performance. The script also plots feature importances to help understand the impact of different features on the predictions.

Exploring Data and Training Models
To perform exploratory data analysis and model training interactively, launch the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook predictive_analytics_forecasting/notebooks/forecasting_notebook.ipynb
In the notebook, you'll find detailed EDA, feature engineering, and model training steps.
